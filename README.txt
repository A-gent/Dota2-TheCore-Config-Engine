//What is this
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
This is a system of .cfg files that control all aspects of the game

Using this, you have full control over what volvo gave you in-game.
 
 
 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//How to set it up
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
1. Remove all in-game keybinds (by left clicking a bind, then right clicking). Do this for all your binds.
 
2. Choose one of the keyboard layouts in the various folders you see here and copy the insides to \Steam\SteamApps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\cfg\
 
3. You can modify the files however you want to match your preference

4. Once the game loads, the autoexec.cfg gets executed automatically. Alternatively, press (default) F8 in-game to reload it.

//How it works?

Magic.

Or if you're really interested, take a sniff through the code, since I left many comments.

Basically, autoexec.cfg the file that Dota2 loads automatically has been transformed into an engine that loads all the other .cfg files in a manner that is easy to modify and understand.
Each config file has its role.
