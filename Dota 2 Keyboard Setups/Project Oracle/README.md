Where did you get the name "Project Oracle"?
Oracle is the only hero for which every ability benefits from all three cast types.

To Install: 
1. Run DisableWinKey.reg to disable your WinKey shortcuts and mobiliy center (if you want to use the x key).* **
2. place the "Game" folder inside of "Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta" and overwrite
3. place the "570" folder inside of "Steam\userdata\[Your 9 digit Steam ID here]" and overwrite
4. launch DotA 2 and customize in-game.
*If you have done anything to your windows key to disable you must undo that first. Alternatively you could
install the Linux or Mac version but you will only have 1 modifier instead of 2.
**To undo my registry edits in step 1 you obvisouly run EnableWinKey.reg

Project Oracle makes use of smart ordering of hotkeys for some heroes which have more than four abilities.
The changes are listed below:
*A space indicates a passive ability. They will still have a hotkey for the next available letter (usually t or g)

1. Techies qwtrge
2. Earth Spirit wqertg
3. IO qwterg
4. Lifestealer q wer
5. Timbersaw qw er
6. Ember Spirit qwert
7. Lone Druid qwert
8. Morphling qwertg
9. Spectre qw er
10. Templar Assassin qw er
11. Chen qwert
12. Keeper of the Light qwertg
13. Ogre Magi qwer
14. Puck qwert
15. Rubick qwgrte
16. Shadow Demon qwert
19. Phoenix qwert

If you would like to change a specific hero, you can do so in-game by simply clicking the clear button for that specific hero.
Ever since this project remapped qwerdf to qwertg some heroes were harder to play 
since the 3rd ability and 4th ability were no longer next to each other on the keyboard. Now, they are
adjacent again. The obscure order of the abilities for these 19 heroes comes from DotA 1's legacy keys.
I find this order to be much easier. You can easily change the ones you don't like.
*Not all heroes which have more than 4 abilities were changed. They were intentionally left out.

Known Issues:
1. Self-cast abilities which are auto-castable are self-casted when the auto-cast hotkey is pressed.
Only affects Ogre Magi, Lich, and neutral troll priest. This is a valve bug and out of my control.
